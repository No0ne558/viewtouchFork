## History

### Origins (1979-1986)

Gene Mosher began writing Point of Sale code on an Apple ][ in 1979. ViewTouch© as we know it today was first created by restaurateur Gene Mosher and C programmer Nick Colley in **1986**, making it the **ORIGINAL Graphical Touchscreen Restaurant Point of Sale Interface**.

**First Public Demonstration:** ComDex, Las Vegas, November 1986  
[See historical photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png)

**Early Platform:** Atari ST computers (1986-1993/4 under Jack Tramiel)

**Initial Funding & Support:**
- Ed Ramsay (1986 - code development funding)
- Barbara Mosher (1986 - present, ongoing financial support)
- John King, M.D., Chicago (early funding)

### Modern Era (1995-1998)

The current version of ViewTouch was created by Gene Mosher and C programmer Richard Bradley, transitioning to:
- **UNIX (AIX)** on Motorola PowerPC (1995)
- **MIT's X Window System** for network-transparent graphical interface (1995)
- **Linux on Intel x86** (1997)

**Major Funding:** Billy Foster (1995-1998)

### Enhancement Period (2000-2004)

- **C to C++ transition** (2000-present day)
- Extensive code enhancement by Bruce King (2000-2004) Ariel Brambila Pelayo (2025)
- **Major Funding:** Doug DeLeeuw

### Open Source Era (2014-Present)

ViewTouch released under GNU Public License (GPL v3) with code hosted on GitHub. Significant modernization and refinement by the open-source community:

**Key Contributors:**
- **Jack Morrison** - Amazing debugging skills
- **NeroBurner (Reinhold Gschweicher)** - Major refactoring and standardization
- **NoOne558 (Ariel Brambila Pelayo)** - Upgraded to Xft scalable fonts, mobile integration, AI-empowered refactoring of the entire ViewTouch code base.
- **Gene and Barbara Mosher** - Lifetime support and funding
- **Ariel Brambila Pelayo** - awarded co-ownership status of ViewTouch code and documentation at GitHub

### Platform Evolution

| Year | Platform | Key Technology |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 1979 | Apple ][ | Initial POS code |
| 1986 | Atari ST | First GUI touchscreen POS |
| 1995 | AIX/PowerPC | UNIX + X Window System |
| 1997 | Linux/x86 | Intel architecture |
| 2000 | Linux/x86 | C++ transition |
| 2016+ | Raspberry Pi | Default platform (Pi 4/5) |

**Current Stack:**
- **OS:** Debian Linux with XFCE desktop
- **Display:** X Window System (network-transparent)
- **Default Hardware:** Raspberry Pi family
- **Auto-update:** Desktop icon compiles and installs latest code from GitHub

Gene Mosher's passion and vision has overseen the development, management, and maintenance of ViewTouch code across six decades, spanning a wide array of computers and point of sale equipment. Gene owns the ViewTouch copyright and remains active in ViewTouch in 2025.  A personal note to everyone from Gene: I am getting on in years and everyone has always wanted me to tell them what will happen to ViewTouch if/when something happens to me. In 2025 I can reassure that I will be participating in the development of ViewTouch until my last breath, which could easily be 2050 (I'll be 101 then), and with Ariel, who is about half a century younger than I am, being awarded co-ownership of the ViewTouch code and documentation at ViewTouch/GitHub, nothing bad can happen, is going to happen, to ViewTouch.  I myself used to wonder about the future of ViewTouch, but I no longer do wonder about the future of ViewTouch.  It's going to be alive, healthy, vibrant and dynamic for a long, long time.  A new chapter has been opened for ViewTouch in 2025 and I could not be happier about it.  Anyone can be a part of the future of ViewTouch - I welcome all who will join us.
