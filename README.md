History
=========
ViewTouch© is the ORIGINAL Graphical Touchscreen Restaurant Point of Sale Interface, first created by restaurateur Gene Mosher and C programmer, Nick Colley, in 1986.  Initial funding of code development beginning in 1986 was due to the financial support of Ed Ramsay.  Barbara Mosher has been a financial supporter since 1986 and continuing into present day.  ViewTouch was first demonstrated to the public at ComDex, Las Vegas, in November, 1986. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png  Early funding was due, in part, by the generosity of John King, M.D., Chicago.  The current version of ViewTouch was first created in 1995-98 by Gene Mosher and C Programmer, Richard Bradley.  Major funding of the development of the code during the '95-'98 period is due to the courageous and very much appreciated efforts of Billy Foster.  Extensive enhancement of the code was carried out from 2000-04 by Bruce King. Major funding of the development of the code during the '00-'04 period is due to the efforts of Doug DeLeeuw.  Since the arrival of ViewTouch under the GNU Public License in 2014 ViewTouch code has been available at GitHub and a great deal of refinement and modernization of the code has taken place.  Special thanks to Jack Morrison for amazing debugging skills, to NeroBurner (Reinhold Gschweicher) for major refactoring and standardization, and to NoOne558 (Ariel Brambila Pelayo) for upgrading the ViewTouch point of sale window manager's reliance upon X core fonts to Xft scalble fonts.  Gene and Barbara Mosher have provided lifetime support and funding for ViewTouch from its inception. Gene owns the ViewTouch copyright. Gene began writing Point of Sale Code on an Apple ][ in 1979; his passion and vision has overseen the development, management and maintainance of the code on a wide array of computers and point of sale equipment across six decades.

More Viewtouch POS (Point of Sale) History
=========
ViewTouch first ran as a C program on the Atari ST computers in 1986. The Atari ST was a very exciting platform under Jack Tramiel from 1985 until 1993/4. In 1995 development of ViewTouch under UNIX (AIX) was initiated. MIT's X Window System was chosen to build the ViewTouch network transparent graphical interface. This decision which was made for ViewTouch in early 1995.
In 1997 a decision was made to move from AIX on the Motorola PowerPC to Linux on the Intel X86. In 2000 a transition from C to C++ took place.  ViewTouch remains on Debian as the default distribution and features the XFCE desktop.
Since 2016 the default hardware platform for Viewtouch is the family of Raspberry Pi computers. ViewTouch production POS computers provide a desktop icon which compiles and installs the latest version of the code from GitHub.
ViewTouch Point of Sale isn't just about the advantage of the power of Linux; it's also about the advantages of the remote display capability of The X Window System. Just add the IP address of remote displays to the ViewTouch page 'View & Manage Displays & Printers'.
