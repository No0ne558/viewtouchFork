## Embossed Text Feature

# Embossed Text Feature Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds an optional embossed text effect to the ViewTouch system, providing a 'frosted' effect on the top and left edges and a 'shadow' effect on the bottom and right edges of text characters. This enhances text contrast and readability while maintaining the option to disable it for performance.

## Features

- **User Configurable**: The embossed text effect can be enabled or disabled through the settings interface
- **Enhanced Readability**: Creates visual depth with highlight and shadow effects
- **Performance Conscious**: Can be disabled to reduce rendering overhead
- **Backward Compatible**: Defaults to enabled but can be turned off

## Implementation Details

### 1. Settings Integration

The feature is integrated into the existing settings system:

- **Setting Name**: `use_embossed_text`
- **Location**: Settings page (General Settings section)
- **Default Value**: Disabled (0) by default; users may enable for higher contrast
- **Settings Version**: 96 (new version for this feature)

### 2. Text Rendering Pipeline

The embossed text effect is implemented in the text rendering pipeline:

1. **Layer::Text()** method now accepts an additional `embossed` parameter
2. **GenericDrawStringXftEmbossed()** function provides the embossed rendering
3. **Terminal view** receives the setting via `TERM_SET_EMBOSSED` command
4. **Settings UI** allows users to toggle the feature on/off

### 3. Embossed Effect Algorithm

The embossed effect creates three layers of text:

1. **Shadow Layer**: Much darker version of the text color (33% intensity) offset by +2,+2 pixels
2. **Highlight Layer**: Lighter version created by adding 40% of remaining white to the original color, offset by -2,-2 pixels  
3. **Main Layer**: Original text color at the base position

This creates a balanced embossed effect with proper lighting and enhanced contrast. The highlight calculation ensures visible lightening while maintaining readability.

### 4. Files Modified

#### Core Implementation
- `generic_char.hh` - Added function declaration
- `generic_char.cc` - Implemented embossed text rendering
- `term/layer.hh` - Updated Text method signature
- `term/layer.cc` - Modified text rendering to use embossed effect

#### Settings System
- `main/settings.hh` - Added use_embossed_text setting
- `main/settings.cc` - Added load/save logic for the setting
- `zone/settings_zone.cc` - Added UI control for the setting

#### Terminal Communication
- `remote_link.hh` - Added TERM_SET_EMBOSSED command
- `term/term_view.hh` - Added global variable declaration
- `term/term_view.cc` - Added command handler and text rendering integration
- `main/terminal.hh` - Added SetEmbossedText method
- `main/terminal.cc` - Implemented SetEmbossedText and initialization
- `debug.cc` - Added debug support for new command

## Usage

### For Users

1. Navigate to Settings in the ViewTouch interface
2. Find "Use Embossed Text Effects?" in the Miscellaneous Settings section
3. Toggle between "Yes" (enabled) and "No" (disabled)
4. Save settings to apply changes

### For Developers

The embossed text effect is automatically applied to all text rendering when enabled. No code changes are required in individual zones or components.

## Performance Considerations

- **Enabled**: Slightly slower rendering due to drawing three text layers
- **Disabled**: Standard rendering performance
- **Memory**: Minimal additional memory usage for color calculations

## Testing

The embossed text feature can be tested by:

1. Building and running the ViewTouch system
2. Navigating to Settings and toggling the "Use Embossed Text Effects?" option
3. Observing the visual difference in text rendering throughout the interface

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

1. **Intensity Control**: Allow users to adjust the embossed effect intensity
2. **Direction Control**: Allow different embossed directions (top-left, bottom-right, etc.)
3. **Color Customization**: Allow custom highlight and shadow colors
4. **Selective Application**: Apply embossed effects only to specific UI elements

## Technical Notes

- The feature uses Xft for high-quality font rendering
- Color calculations are done in 16-bit color space (0-65535)
- The effect works with all existing fonts and colors
- No changes to the existing text positioning or layout systems

## F3 F4 Recording Control

# F3/F4 Recording Control Feature

## Overview

This feature adds user control over the F3/F4 recording and replay functionality in ViewTouch, allowing administrators to enable or disable this debugging feature based on their needs.

## Background

The F3/F4 recording feature is a powerful debugging tool that allows developers and testers to:
- **F3**: Start/stop recording a sequence of touches and keystrokes
- **F4**: Replay the recorded sequence
- **Double F3**: Erase the recorded sequence

However, this feature was previously only controlled by the `debug_mode` flag and could cause issues in production environments where users might accidentally trigger long replay sequences.

## New Implementation

### Settings Integration

The F3/F4 recording feature is now controlled through the ViewTouch Soft Switches page:

- **Setting Name**: `enable_f3_f4_recording`
- **Location**: Soft Switches page → "Enable F3/F4 Recording/Replay?" toggle
- **Default Value**: Disabled (0) for safety
- **UI Control**: On/Off toggle button that shows current status

### Access Control

The feature now requires only **one condition** to be met:
1. `enable_f3_f4_recording` setting must be enabled (Soft Switch)

This provides direct user control:
- **Single Control Point**: Users can enable/disable recording directly from the Soft Switches page
- **No Debug Mode Required**: Eliminates the need for system-level debug configuration
- **Cleaner Interface**: Simpler user experience with fewer configuration steps

## Usage

### For Developers and Testers

1. **Enable Recording**: Go to Soft Switches page → "Enable F3/F4 Recording/Replay?" → On
2. **Use Recording**:
   - Press **F3** to start recording touches and keystrokes
   - Perform the actions you want to record
   - Press **F3** again to stop recording
   - Press **F4** to replay the recorded sequence
   - Press **F3** twice quickly to erase the recording

### For Production Environments

- **Default**: Recording is disabled by default for safety
- **Selective Enable**: Can be enabled only for specific terminals or users who need it
- **Easy Disable**: Can be quickly disabled if issues arise

## Benefits

### Safety Improvements
- **Accidental Prevention**: Users can't accidentally trigger recording/replay
- **Production Safe**: Default disabled state prevents production issues
- **Controlled Access**: Only authorized users can enable the feature

### Developer Experience

### System Stability
- **Reduced Risk**: Eliminates accidental long replay sequences
- **User Control**: Administrators can manage feature access
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved when enabled

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

1. **Settings Class**: Added `enable_f3_f4_recording` variable
2. **Soft Switches UI**: Added On/Off toggle button in SwitchZone
3. **Terminal Logic**: Modified F3/F4 handlers to check the new setting
4. **Default Values**: Set to disabled (0) for safety

### File Modifications

- `main/settings.hh`: Added new setting variable
- `main/settings.cc`: Added default value in constructor
- `main/labels.cc`: Added switch name and value to arrays
- `zone/settings_zone.cc`: Added switch handling in SwitchZone
- `main/terminal.cc`: Modified F3/F4 key handlers

### Settings Persistence

The setting is automatically saved with other settings and persists across system restarts.

## Configuration Examples

### Enable for Development
```cpp
// In settings or configuration
enable_f3_f4_recording = 1;
```

### Disable for Production
```cpp
// Default safe configuration
enable_f3_f4_recording = 0;
```

### Conditional Enable
```cpp
// Enable only for specific terminals
if (terminal_id == DEV_TERMINAL_ID) {
    enable_f3_f4_recording = 1;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **User-Level Control**: Allow specific users to enable/disable recording
- **Recording Limits**: Add maximum recording duration or size limits
- **Recording History**: Store multiple recordings with names/descriptions
- **Export/Import**: Allow sharing recordings between systems
- **Recording Validation**: Check recording validity before replay

### Integration Opportunities
- **Training Mode**: Use recordings for user training scenarios
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate with testing frameworks
- **Quality Assurance**: Standardize testing procedures with recordings
- **Documentation**: Create visual guides using recorded sequences

## Conclusion

## Migration To Xft

# ViewTouch Xft Font System Migration

This document describes the migration from legacy bitmapped fonts to the modern Xft (X FreeType) scalable font system in ViewTouch.

## Installing Fonts for Xft / Fontconfig Systems

### 📁 Where Xft Gets Fonts

Xft doesn't have its own font path. Instead, it uses **Fontconfig**, which automatically scans these locations:

- **System-wide** fonts:  
  - `/usr/share/fonts/`  
  - `/usr/local/share/fonts/`  

- **User-local** fonts:  
  - `~/.fonts/` (deprecated but still supported)  
  - `~/.local/share/fonts/` (modern Fontconfig default)

To verify what fonts are available:
```bash
fc-list | grep -i "bookman"
```

## Font Installation Process

### System-wide Installation

1. **Create font directory** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype
   ```

2. **Copy font files** to the directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp your-font.ttf /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/
   ```

3. **Update font cache**:
   ```bash
   sudo fc-cache -fv
   ```

### User-local Installation

1. **Create user font directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
   ```

2. **Copy font files**:
   ```bash
   cp your-font.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/
   ```

3. **Update user font cache**:
   ```bash
   fc-cache -fv
   ```

## Supported Font Formats

Fontconfig supports multiple font formats:
- **TrueType** (`.ttf`, `.ttc`)
- **OpenType** (`.otf`)
- **Type 1** (`.pfa`, `.pfb`)
- **Bitmap fonts** (`.bdf`, `.pcf`)

## Troubleshooting

### Check Available Fonts
```bash
fc-list | head -20
```

### Check Font Configuration
```bash
fc-match "Arial"
```

### Debug Font Loading
```bash
FC_DEBUG=1 fc-match "Your Font Name"
```

### Verify Font Installation
```bash
fc-cache -v | grep "your-font"
```

## ViewTouch Font Configuration

ViewTouch supports multiple font families:

### Default Fonts
- **Times** (serif) - Legacy compatibility
- **DejaVu Sans** (sans-serif) - Modern default
- **DejaVu Sans Mono** (monospace) - For numbers and prices

### Classic Serif Fonts (New)
- **EB Garamond 8** - Elegant serif font with excellent readability
- **Bookman** - Warm, readable serif font
- **Nimbus Roman** - Clean, professional serif font

### Font Usage in Code
```cpp
// Example usage of new fonts
ZoneText("Welcome", 0, 0, width, height, COLOR_BLACK, FONT_GARAMOND_24, ALIGN_CENTER);
ZoneText("Menu Items", 0, 0, width, height, COLOR_BLACK, FONT_BOOKMAN_18, ALIGN_LEFT);
ZoneText("$12.99", 0, 0, width, height, COLOR_BLACK, FONT_NIMBUS_20, ALIGN_RIGHT);
```

### Installing the New Fonts

#### EB Garamond 8
```bash
# Download from Google Fonts
wget https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Regular.ttf
sudo cp EBGaramond-Regular.ttf /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/
sudo fc-cache -fv
```

#### Bookman
```bash
# Install from package manager (if available)
sudo apt-get install fonts-urw-base35  # Includes Bookman
# Or manually install Bookman font files
```

#### Nimbus Roman
```bash
# Install from package manager
sudo apt-get install fonts-urw-base35  # Includes Nimbus Roman
# Or manually install Nimbus Roman font files
```

To use custom fonts, ensure they are properly installed in one of the Fontconfig directories listed above, then restart ViewTouch for the changes to take effect.

1. **Embossed Text Effect** - Adds frosted highlights and shadows for a 3D appearance
2. **Anti-aliasing** - Smooths text edges for improved readability
3. **Drop Shadows** - Adds subtle shadows behind text for depth

## Features

### 1. Embossed Text Effect
- **Description**: Creates a frosted glass effect with highlights on top/left edges and shadows on bottom/right edges
- **Default**: Disabled (`use_embossed_text = 0`)
- **Visual Effect**: Text appears to be raised from the surface with a subtle 3D appearance
- **Implementation**: Uses Xft rendering with carefully calculated highlight and shadow colors

### 2. Anti-aliasing
- **Description**: Smooths text edges using subpixel rendering
- **Default**: Enabled (`use_text_antialiasing = 1`)
- **Visual Effect**: Text appears smoother and more readable, especially at smaller sizes
- **Implementation**: Enhanced Xft rendering with optimized color calculations

### 3. Drop Shadows
- **Description**: Adds configurable drop shadows behind text
- **Default**: Disabled (`use_drop_shadows = 0`)
- **Visual Effect**: Text appears to float above the background
- **Implementation**: Multiple shadow layers with blur effect for realistic appearance

## Unified Targeting Summary

# Unified Video and Printer Targeting System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a unified targeting system that automatically synchronizes Video and Printer targeting functionality. When either Video Target or Print Target zones are used, both arrays are automatically updated to ensure they always match, eliminating the need for separate configuration and ensuring that "Video Targets must match Printer Targets" as requested.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Existing Targeting Zones**
- **Modified**: `zone/video_zone.cc` and `zone/printer_zone.cc`
- **Purpose**: Both existing zones now automatically synchronize video and printer targets
- **Features**:
  - Automatic synchronization of both `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays
  - Updated titles to "Video & Printer Targets by Family"
  - Proper bounds checking and NULL pointer validation
  - No changes required to existing page configurations

### 2. **Key Features**

#### **Automatic Synchronization**
- When saving from Video Target zone: both `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays are updated
- When saving from Print Target zone: both `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays are updated
- Ensures that video targets always match printer targets
- Eliminates the possibility of mismatched configurations

#### **Improved User Experience**
- Clear indication that both video and printer targets are being set
- No need to configure targets separately
- Consistent behavior across both targeting zones
- Existing page configurations continue to work without modification

#### **Robust Error Handling**
- Proper bounds checking with `MAX_FAMILIES` constant
- NULL pointer validation for `FamilyName` array
- Form field validation in load/save operations

### 3. **Technical Implementation**

#### **Data Flow**
- **Load**: Reads from appropriate array based on zone type
- **Save**: Writes to both arrays to ensure synchronization
- **Display**: Shows "Video & Printer Targets by Family" title

#### **Synchronization Logic**
```cpp
// In VideoTargetZone::SaveRecord()
settings->video_target[idx] = value;
settings->family_printer[idx] = value;

// In PrintTargetZone::SaveRecord()
s->family_printer[z] = value;
s->video_target[z] = value;
```

### 4. **Benefits**

#### **For Users**
- **Simplified Configuration**: Only need to set targets once
- **Clear Instructions**: Title indicates both video and printer targets are affected
- **Consistent Data**: Automatic synchronization prevents mismatches
- **Familiar Interface**: Uses existing page configurations

#### **For System**
- **Reduced Complexity**: No need for separate unified zone
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic synchronization prevents configuration errors
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configurations work without changes
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend with additional targeting features

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Original `VideoTargetZone` and `PrintTargetZone` remain available
- Existing page configurations work without modification
- All existing functionality preserved
- No migration required

### 6. **Testing Status**
- ✅ **Compilation**: Successfully builds without errors
- ✅ **Integration**: Properly integrated into existing zone system
- ✅ **Installation**: Successfully installed and ready for use
- 🔄 **Runtime Testing**: Ready for functional testing

## Usage Instructions

### **For System Administrators**
- No changes required to existing page configurations
- Both Video Target and Print Target zones now automatically synchronize
- Use either zone - both will set both video and printer targets

### **For End Users**
1. Access either the Video Target or Print Target page
2. Configure family targeting as needed
3. Changes are automatically synchronized between both systems
4. Both video and printer targets will always match

## How It Works

### **Before (Separate Configuration)**
- Video Target zone only set `video_target` array
- Print Target zone only set `family_printer` array
- Users had to configure both separately
- Risk of mismatched configurations

### **After (Unified Configuration)**
- Video Target zone sets both `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays
- Print Target zone sets both `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays
- Users only need to configure once
- Automatic synchronization ensures consistency

## Conclusion
The unified targeting system successfully addresses the requirement to ensure Video and Printer targets always match while maintaining backward compatibility with existing page configurations. The implementation is robust, maintainable, and ready for production use.

## Video Target Routing Fix

### Problem Description

Users reported that items were not being routed to their correct video targets based on their family settings. Specifically:

- **Burgers** (family set to "burger") with printer target "default" and video target "kitchen 1" were correctly sent to kitchen 1
- **Pina Colada** (family set to "cocktail") with printer target "default" and video target "bar 1" were incorrectly being sent to kitchen 1 instead of bar 1

This caused all items to be routed to the kitchen video display regardless of their family-specific video target settings.

### Root Cause

The problem was **incorrect array indexing** in the `Order::VideoTarget()` method in `main/check.cc`. The method was using `FindIndexOfValue(item_family, FamilyValue)` to get the position in the `FamilyValue` array, then using that position to index the `video_target` array. However, the `video_target` array is indexed by the actual family ID values, not by the position in the `FamilyValue` array.

### Solution Implemented

Fixed the `Order::VideoTarget()` method to use direct indexing:

```cpp
// Before (incorrect):
int fvalue = FindIndexOfValue(item_family, FamilyValue);
return settings->video_target[fvalue];

// After (correct):
return settings->video_target[item_family];
```

### How It Works Now

- **Direct Indexing**: The method now directly uses `item_family` to access the `video_target` array
- **Correct Family Mapping**: Each item's family ID directly maps to its corresponding video target setting
- **Proper Routing**: Items are now routed to the correct video display based on their family settings

## Video and Printer Target Loading Fix

### Problem Description

Users reported that video and printer target settings by family were not being saved and loaded correctly when editing the video and printer target pages. The settings would appear to save but would reset to default values when returning to the page.

### Root Cause

The problem was **incorrect array indexing** in both `VideoTargetZone` and `PrintTargetZone`. The zones were using the loop index `idx` directly to access the `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays, but these arrays are indexed by the actual family ID values (like `FAMILY_ALACARTE`, `FAMILY_APPETIZERS`, etc.), not by the position in the `FamilyValue` array.

### Solution Implemented

Fixed both zones to use `FamilyValue[idx]` for proper array indexing:

#### VideoTargetZone (`zone/video_zone.cc`)
```cpp
// LoadRecord - Fixed
form->Set(settings->video_target[FamilyValue[idx]]);

// SaveRecord - Fixed  
settings->video_target[FamilyValue[idx]] = value;
settings->family_printer[FamilyValue[idx]] = value;
```

#### PrintTargetZone (`zone/printer_zone.cc`)
```cpp
// LoadRecord - Fixed
f->Set(s->family_printer[FamilyValue[z]]);

// SaveRecord - Fixed
s->family_printer[FamilyValue[z]] = value;
s->video_target[FamilyValue[z]] = value;
```

### How It Works Now

- **Correct Indexing**: Both zones now use `FamilyValue[idx]` to access the proper array positions
- **Proper Data Flow**: Settings are saved to and loaded from the correct family ID positions
- **Maintained Synchronization**: The unified targeting system continues to work, ensuring video and printer targets always match

## Complete Kitchen and Bar Video Separation

### Problem Description

Previously, when either the kitchen OR bar marked an order as "served" in their video display, it would affect the entire check's global state and remove it from BOTH video displays. Additionally, highlighting (first tap) was also affecting both displays.

### Root Cause

The system was using global `check_state` and single flags that affected all video displays instead of separate tracking for each video target.

### Solution Implemented

#### New Check Flags

Added four independent check flags to track status separately:

```cpp
#define CF_KITCHEN_MADE      16  // Kitchen has marked their portion as made/ready
#define CF_BAR_MADE          32  // Bar has marked their portion as made/ready
#define CF_KITCHEN_SERVED    64  // Kitchen has marked their portion as served
#define CF_BAR_SERVED        128 // Bar has marked their portion as served
```

#### Independent Highlighting (First Tap)

```cpp
// Check if this specific video target has already marked their portion as made
int already_made = 0;
if (video_target == PRINTER_BAR1 || video_target == PRINTER_BAR2)
{
    // Bar video - check if bar portion already made
    already_made = (reportcheck->flags & CF_BAR_MADE);
}
else
{
    // Kitchen video - check if kitchen portion already made
    already_made = (reportcheck->flags & CF_KITCHEN_MADE);
}

if (!already_made)
{
    // first toggle - mark as made/ready for this video target
    if (video_target == PRINTER_BAR1 || video_target == PRINTER_BAR2)
    {
        // Bar video - mark bar portion as made
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_BAR_MADE;
    }
    else
    {
        // Kitchen video - mark kitchen portion as made
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_KITCHEN_MADE;
    }
    reportcheck->made_time.Set();
}
```

#### Independent Serving (Second Tap)

```cpp
else
{
    // then toggle served based on video target
    if (video_target == PRINTER_BAR1 || video_target == PRINTER_BAR2)
    {
        // Bar video - mark bar portion as served
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_BAR_SERVED;
    }
    else
    {
        // Kitchen video - mark kitchen portion as served
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_KITCHEN_SERVED;
    }
    reportcheck->flags |= CF_SHOWN;
    reportcheck->SetOrderStatus(NULL, ORDER_SHOWN);
}
```

### How It Works Now

- **Independent Highlighting**: Each video target can highlight orders independently
- **Independent Serving**: Each video target can mark orders as served independently
- **No Cross-Interference**: Actions on one video target never affect the other
- **Complete Workflow Independence**: Each department manages their own portion of orders

---

## Settings Persistence Improvements

### Problem Description

Video and printer target settings by family were being reset to "None" when saving settings and then returning to them later. This caused configuration to be lost and required re-setting targets repeatedly.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Problematic Default Values**: The Settings constructor was using `PRINTER_NONE` (99) as the default for `family_printer` arrays
2. **Version Compatibility**: Settings files with version < 34 weren't loading `video_target` arrays, leaving them with default values
3. **Premature Settings Save**: The manager was calling `settings->Save()` immediately after loading, potentially overwriting loaded values with defaults

### Solutions Implemented

#### Fixed Default Values

Changed the Settings constructor to use more sensible defaults:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < MAX_FAMILIES; ++i)
{
    family_printer[i] = PRINTER_DEFAULT;  // Changed from PRINTER_NONE to PRINTER_DEFAULT
    family_group[i]   = SALESGROUP_FOOD;
    video_target[i]   = PRINTER_DEFAULT;
}
```

#### Enhanced Loading Logic

Modified the loading logic to ensure compatibility with older version files:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < MAX_FAMILIES; ++i)
{
    df.Read(family_group[i]);
    df.Read(family_printer[i]);
    if ( version >= 34 )
    {
        df.Read(video_target[i]);
    }
    else
    {
        // For older version files, set video_target to match family_printer
        // This ensures compatibility and prevents resetting to defaults
        video_target[i] = family_printer[i];
    }
    
    // Ensure family_printer doesn't get reset to PRINTER_NONE
    // If it was loaded as PRINTER_NONE, change it to PRINTER_DEFAULT
    if (family_printer[i] == PRINTER_NONE)
    {
        family_printer[i] = PRINTER_DEFAULT;
    }
}
```

#### Fixed Manager Settings Save

Moved the `settings->Save()` call inside the successful load block to prevent overwriting loaded values:

```cpp
// Load Settings
ReportLoader("Loading General Settings");
Settings *settings = &sys->settings;
sys->FullPath(MASTER_SETTINGS, str);
if (settings->Load(str))
{
    RestoreBackup(str);
    settings->Load(str);
    // Now that we have the settings, we need to do some initialization
    sys->account_db.low_acct_num = settings->low_acct_num;
    sys->account_db.high_acct_num = settings->high_acct_num;
    // Only save if we successfully loaded settings
    settings->Save();
}
```

### How It Works Now

- **Sensible Defaults**: Arrays are initialized with `PRINTER_DEFAULT` instead of problematic `PRINTER_NONE`
- **Version Compatibility**: Older settings files are properly handled with fallback values
- **Proper Save Timing**: Settings are only saved after successful loading
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: System works with both old and new settings file formats

## XServer XSDL Configuration for Android Displays

### Overview

ViewTouch supports running on Android devices using XServer XSDL as an external display. This allows you to use Android tablets or phones as additional touchscreen displays for your POS system.

### Prerequisites

- Android device with XServer XSDL installed
- ViewTouch compiled with X11 support
- Both devices on the same network

### XServer XSDL Setup

1. **Install XServer XSDL** on your Android device from the Google Play Store
2. **Configure Network Settings**:
   - Open XServer XSDL on Android
   - Go to **Settings** → **Network**
   - Ensure **"Allow connections from network"** is **enabled**
   - **Important**: Turn **Random MAC** **OFF**
   - Configure **Metered Connection** appropriately for your network

3. **Start XServer XSDL** and note the IP address displayed in the app

### Connecting ViewTouch to XServer XSDL

Once XServer XSDL is running on your Android device:

```bash
# Set the DISPLAY environment variable to your Android device's IP
export DISPLAY=192.168.1.XXX:0

# Test the connection
xdpyinfo

# If successful, launch ViewTouch
sudo /usr/viewtouch/bin/vtpos
```

Replace `192.168.1.XXX` with your Android device's actual IP address.

### Troubleshooting

#### Network Connectivity Issues
- **Ping test**: `ping 192.168.1.XXX`
- **Port check**: `telnet 192.168.1.XXX 6000`
- **Firewall**: Ensure no firewall blocks are preventing X11 connections (port 6000)

#### XServer XSDL Settings
- **Random MAC**: Must be **OFF** for stable connections
- **Metered Connection**: Configure based on your network type
- **Display Resolution**: XServer XSDL is optimized for 1920x1080 resolution

#### Common DISPLAY Values
```bash
# Standard connection
export DISPLAY=192.168.1.244:0

# With explicit screen number
export DISPLAY=192.168.1.244:0.0

# If using different port/display number
export DISPLAY=192.168.1.244:1
```

### Display Resolution

ViewTouch is optimized for 1920x1080 resolution when using XServer XSDL. The Android-specific patches ensure proper font rendering and touchscreen compatibility.

### Security Notes

- XServer XSDL allows network connections by default
- Consider firewall rules if running in a public network environment
- The connection is unencrypted - use trusted networks only
