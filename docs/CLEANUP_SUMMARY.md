# ViewTouch Directory Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Removed Stray Files
- Deleted the stray file `h -u origin master` from the root directory

### ✅ 2. Enhanced .gitignore
- Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes:
  - Build artifacts (*.o, *.a, *.so, etc.)
  - CMake generated files
  - Generated version files
  - Temporary files (*.tmp, *.temp, *.log, etc.)
  - IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)
  - Package files (*.tar.gz, *.zip, *.deb, *.rpm)

### ✅ 3. Organized Source Code Structure
Created a cleaner directory structure by moving scattered source files:

**New `src/` directory structure:**
```
src/
├── core/           # Core functionality
│   ├── conf_file.cc/.hh
│   ├── data_file.cc/.hh
│   ├── data_persistence_manager.cc/.hh
│   ├── debug.cc/.hh
│   ├── error_handler.cc/.hh
│   ├── generic_char.cc/.hh
│   ├── image_data.cc/.hh
│   ├── logger.cc/.hh
│   ├── time_info.cc/.hh
│   ├── inttypes.h
│   ├── basic.hh
│   └── list_utility.hh
├── utils/          # Utility functions
│   ├── utility.cc/.hh
│   ├── string_utils.cc/.hh
│   ├── fntrace.cc/.hh
│   └── font_check.cc
└── network/        # Network-related code
    ├── remote_link.cc/.hh
    ├── socket.cc/.hh
    └── vt_ccq_pipe.cc/.hh
```

### ✅ 4. Organized Font Directory
- Removed archive files (*.zip, *.tar.gz)
- Organized fonts into family-specific subdirectories:
  - `dejavu/` - DejaVu font family
  - `liberation/` - Liberation font family
  - `urw/` - URW font family
  - `nimbus/` - Nimbus font family
  - `ebgaramond/` - EB Garamond font family

### ✅ 5. Updated Build Configuration
- Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to reflect new directory structure
- Added include directories for the new `src/` subdirectories
- Updated all library and executable targets to use new file paths
- Maintained all existing functionality

### ✅ 6. Created Development Documentation
- Created `DEVELOPMENT.md` with comprehensive development workflow
- Documented the new directory structure
- Provided build instructions and guidelines
- Included troubleshooting tips and best practices

## Build Verification

✅ **Build Test Passed**: The project builds successfully after reorganization
- All targets compile without errors
- Only expected warnings (unused parameters, type conversions) remain
- All executables are generated correctly

## Benefits of the Cleanup

1. **Better Organization**: Source files are now logically grouped by functionality
2. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Reduced clutter in the main project directory
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify related code
4. **Professional Structure**: Follows modern C++ project organization standards
5. **Enhanced Development Experience**: Clear separation of concerns and better documentation

## Next Steps for Developers

1. **Follow the new structure** when adding new source files
2. **Use the development workflow** documented in `DEVELOPMENT.md`
3. **Update any external scripts** that reference the old file locations
4. **Consider further organization** of the `main/` directory if needed

## Files Modified

- `.gitignore` - Enhanced with comprehensive exclusions
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Updated paths and include directories
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - New development workflow documentation
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Files Moved

- 20+ source files moved from root to organized `src/` subdirectories
- Font files organized into family-specific directories
- Archive files removed from fonts directory

The ViewTouch project now has a much cleaner, more professional directory structure that will improve development workflow and maintainability.
