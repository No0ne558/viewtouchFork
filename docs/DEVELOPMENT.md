# ViewTouch Development Workflow

This document outlines the clean development workflow for ViewTouch after the recent directory reorganization.

```

## Build Process

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.5.1 or higher
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 12+, Clang 16+)
- X11 development libraries
- Motif development libraries
- Freetype development libraries
- Fontconfig development libraries

### Building
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build the project
make -j$(nproc)

# Install (requires sudo)
sudo make install
```

### Running
```bash
# Start ViewTouch (automatically opens vt_term)
sudo /usr/viewtouch/bin/vtpos
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Core functionality** goes in `src/core/`
- **Utility functions** go in `src/utils/`
- **Network code** goes in `src/network/`
- **Main application logic** stays in `main/`
- **UI components** stay in `zone/`

### File Naming
- Use descriptive names for source files
- Keep header and source files paired (.cc/.hh)
- Use snake_case for file names

### CMake Integration
- All new source files must be added to appropriate CMakeLists.txt targets
- Include directories are automatically configured for the new structure
- External dependencies are managed in the external/ directory

### Testing
- Test code should be placed in a `tests/` directory (when created)
- Use Catch2 v3 for unit testing
- Build tests with `cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..`

## Clean Development Practices

### Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for development
- Commit working code only after testing
- Use descriptive commit messages

### Build Artifacts
- Build directory is ignored by git
- Generated files are excluded via .gitignore
- Clean builds recommended for testing

### Font Management
- Fonts are organized by family in subdirectories
- Archive files are excluded from the repository
- Use EB Garamond 14 Bold (FONT_GARAMOND_14B) as standard UI font

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
1. Clean build directory: `rm -rf build && mkdir build`
2. Check dependencies: `apt list --installed | grep -E "(xorg-dev|libmotif-dev|libfreetype6-dev)"`
3. Verify CMake version: `cmake --version`

### Runtime Issues
1. Check permissions: ViewTouch requires sudo for system-wide operation
2. Verify X11 display: `echo $DISPLAY`
3. Check font availability: Fonts are bundled in the fonts/ directory

## Contributing

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Update CMakeLists.txt for new source files
3. Test builds before committing
4. Document significant changes
5. Use the project's coding standards (C++20, modern practices)

## Memory Management

The project uses modern C++17/20 features including:
- Smart pointers for memory safety
- RAII principles
- Automatic resource management
- Exception safety

Avoid raw pointers and manual memory management where possible.
