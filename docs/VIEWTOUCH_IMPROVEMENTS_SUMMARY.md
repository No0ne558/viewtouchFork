## Video Target Routing Fix

### Problem Description

Users reported that items were not being routed to their correct video targets based on their family settings. Specifically:

- **Burgers** (family set to "burger") with printer target "default" and video target "kitchen 1" were correctly sent to kitchen 1
- **Pina Colada** (family set to "cocktail") with printer target "default" and video target "bar 1" were incorrectly being sent to kitchen 1 instead of bar 1

This caused all items to be routed to the kitchen video display regardless of their family-specific video target settings.

### Root Cause

The problem was **incorrect array indexing** in the `Order::VideoTarget()` method in `main/check.cc`. The method was using `FindIndexOfValue(item_family, FamilyValue)` to get the position in the `FamilyValue` array, then using that position to index the `video_target` array. However, the `video_target` array is indexed by the actual family ID values, not by the position in the `FamilyValue` array.

### Solution Implemented

Fixed the `Order::VideoTarget()` method to use direct indexing:

```cpp
// Before (incorrect):
int fvalue = FindIndexOfValue(item_family, FamilyValue);
return settings->video_target[fvalue];

// After (correct):
return settings->video_target[item_family];
```

### How It Works Now

- **Direct Indexing**: The method now directly uses `item_family` to access the `video_target` array
- **Correct Family Mapping**: Each item's family ID directly maps to its corresponding video target setting
- **Proper Routing**: Items are now routed to the correct video display based on their family settings

## Video and Printer Target Loading Fix

### Problem Description

Users reported that video and printer target settings by family were not being saved and loaded correctly when editing the video and printer target pages. The settings would appear to save but would reset to default values when returning to the page.

### Root Cause

The problem was **incorrect array indexing** in both `VideoTargetZone` and `PrintTargetZone`. The zones were using the loop index `idx` directly to access the `video_target` and `family_printer` arrays, but these arrays are indexed by the actual family ID values (like `FAMILY_ALACARTE`, `FAMILY_APPETIZERS`, etc.), not by the position in the `FamilyValue` array.

### Solution Implemented

Fixed both zones to use `FamilyValue[idx]` for proper array indexing:

#### VideoTargetZone (`zone/video_zone.cc`)
```cpp
// LoadRecord - Fixed
form->Set(settings->video_target[FamilyValue[idx]]);

// SaveRecord - Fixed  
settings->video_target[FamilyValue[idx]] = value;
settings->family_printer[FamilyValue[idx]] = value;
```

#### PrintTargetZone (`zone/printer_zone.cc`)
```cpp
// LoadRecord - Fixed
f->Set(s->family_printer[FamilyValue[z]]);

// SaveRecord - Fixed
s->family_printer[FamilyValue[z]] = value;
s->video_target[FamilyValue[z]] = value;
```

### How It Works Now

- **Correct Indexing**: Both zones now use `FamilyValue[idx]` to access the proper array positions
- **Proper Data Flow**: Settings are saved to and loaded from the correct family ID positions
- **Maintained Synchronization**: The unified targeting system continues to work, ensuring video and printer targets always match

## Complete Kitchen and Bar Video Separation

### Problem Description

Previously, when either the kitchen OR bar marked an order as "served" in their video display, it would affect the entire check's global state and remove it from BOTH video displays. Additionally, highlighting (first tap) was also affecting both displays.

### Root Cause

The system was using global `check_state` and single flags that affected all video displays instead of separate tracking for each video target.

### Solution Implemented

#### New Check Flags

Added four independent check flags to track status separately:

```cpp
#define CF_KITCHEN_MADE      16  // Kitchen has marked their portion as made/ready
#define CF_BAR_MADE          32  // Bar has marked their portion as made/ready
#define CF_KITCHEN_SERVED    64  // Kitchen has marked their portion as served
#define CF_BAR_SERVED        128 // Bar has marked their portion as served
```

#### Independent Highlighting (First Tap)

```cpp
// Check if this specific video target has already marked their portion as made
int already_made = 0;
if (video_target == PRINTER_BAR1 || video_target == PRINTER_BAR2)
{
    // Bar video - check if bar portion already made
    already_made = (reportcheck->flags & CF_BAR_MADE);
}
else
{
    // Kitchen video - check if kitchen portion already made
    already_made = (reportcheck->flags & CF_KITCHEN_MADE);
}

if (!already_made)
{
    // first toggle - mark as made/ready for this video target
    if (video_target == PRINTER_BAR1 || video_target == PRINTER_BAR2)
    {
        // Bar video - mark bar portion as made
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_BAR_MADE;
    }
    else
    {
        // Kitchen video - mark kitchen portion as made
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_KITCHEN_MADE;
    }
    reportcheck->made_time.Set();
}
```

#### Independent Serving (Second Tap)

```cpp
else
{
    // then toggle served based on video target
    if (video_target == PRINTER_BAR1 || video_target == PRINTER_BAR2)
    {
        // Bar video - mark bar portion as served
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_BAR_SERVED;
    }
    else
    {
        // Kitchen video - mark kitchen portion as served
        reportcheck->flags |= CF_KITCHEN_SERVED;
    }
    reportcheck->flags |= CF_SHOWN;
    reportcheck->SetOrderStatus(NULL, ORDER_SHOWN);
}
```

### How It Works Now

- **Independent Highlighting**: Each video target can highlight orders independently
- **Independent Serving**: Each video target can mark orders as served independently
- **No Cross-Interference**: Actions on one video target never affect the other
- **Complete Workflow Independence**: Each department manages their own portion of orders

## Settings Persistence Improvements

### Problem Description

Video and printer target settings by family were being reset to "None" when saving settings and then returning to them later. This caused configuration to be lost and required re-setting targets repeatedly.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Problematic Default Values**: The Settings constructor was using `PRINTER_NONE` (99) as the default for `family_printer` arrays
2. **Version Compatibility**: Settings files with version < 34 weren't loading `video_target` arrays, leaving them with default values
3. **Premature Settings Save**: The manager was calling `settings->Save()` immediately after loading, potentially overwriting loaded values with defaults

### Solutions Implemented

#### Fixed Default Values

Changed the Settings constructor to use more sensible defaults:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < MAX_FAMILIES; ++i)
{
    family_printer[i] = PRINTER_DEFAULT;  // Changed from PRINTER_NONE to PRINTER_DEFAULT
    family_group[i]   = SALESGROUP_FOOD;
    video_target[i]   = PRINTER_DEFAULT;
}
```

#### Enhanced Loading Logic

Modified the loading logic to ensure compatibility with older version files:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < MAX_FAMILIES; ++i)
{
    df.Read(family_group[i]);
    df.Read(family_printer[i]);
    if ( version >= 34 )
    {
        df.Read(video_target[i]);
    }
    else
    {
        // For older version files, set video_target to match family_printer
        // This ensures compatibility and prevents resetting to defaults
        video_target[i] = family_printer[i];
    }
    
    // Ensure family_printer doesn't get reset to PRINTER_NONE
    // If it was loaded as PRINTER_NONE, change it to PRINTER_DEFAULT
    if (family_printer[i] == PRINTER_NONE)
    {
        family_printer[i] = PRINTER_DEFAULT;
    }
}
```

#### Fixed Manager Settings Save

Moved the `settings->Save()` call inside the successful load block to prevent overwriting loaded values:

```cpp
// Load Settings
ReportLoader("Loading General Settings");
Settings *settings = &sys->settings;
sys->FullPath(MASTER_SETTINGS, str);
if (settings->Load(str))
{
    RestoreBackup(str);
    settings->Load(str);
    // Now that we have the settings, we need to do some initialization
    sys->account_db.low_acct_num = settings->low_acct_num;
    sys->account_db.high_acct_num = settings->high_acct_num;
    // Only save if we successfully loaded settings
    settings->Save();
}
```

### How It Works Now

- **Sensible Defaults**: Arrays are initialized with `PRINTER_DEFAULT` instead of problematic `PRINTER_NONE`
- **Version Compatibility**: Older settings files are properly handled with fallback values
- **Proper Save Timing**: Settings are only saved after successful loading
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: System works with both old and new settings file formats

## Configuration Requirements

### Video Target Settings

For the system to work properly, ensure:

1. **Family Video Targets**: Configure each family's video target in the Video Target zone
   - Food families → Kitchen video targets
   - Beverage families → Bar video targets

2. **Video Display Pages**: Set up separate video display pages for kitchen and bar
   - Kitchen video pages with `video_target` set to kitchen targets
   - Bar video pages with `video_target` set to bar targets

### Example Configuration

```
Family: Burgers → Video Target: Kitchen 1
Family: Cocktails → Video Target: Bar 1
Family: Appetizers → Video Target: Kitchen 1
Family: Wine → Video Target: Bar 1
```
